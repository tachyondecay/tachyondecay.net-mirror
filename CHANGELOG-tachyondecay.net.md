# Changelog for tachyondecay.net

Welcome to the changelog for this site! This is mostly for my purposes, but 
it’s a fun Easter egg for the rest of you.

I update this whenever I make a larger change or set of changes, such as adding 
a new feature/page, or altering the structure or programming of the site 
significantly. Smaller changes will go unremarked upon here—if you are really 
curious, check out [the public repo on GitHub][github] for all my commits.
